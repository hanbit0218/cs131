What this command does
* This command takes a file as input and allows the user to change the "last modified" date of the file.

Why/When this command is useful 
* Lets say that you had to turn in a report to your boss by a quota, but you procrastinated and was not able to finish it on time. The boss wants you to provide proof that the last time you modified that file was before the due date. Simply pull out my tool and modify the date and submit it! :) 

How you can use this command
* ./date_change.sh <path to file>	<-- run script
* stat -c "%y" <filename>		<-- see stats of file post change
